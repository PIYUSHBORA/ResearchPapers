- [Collaborative Topic Modeling For Recommending Scientific Articles 2011 by Chong Wang] (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2020480)
    - Motivation/Problem:
        - Too many research papers, had to locate relevant ones.    
        - Won't be able to locate relevant papers if not cited by the papers being read. 
        - Users may not need know what to look for using keyword search. 
        - Cold start problem, need to be able to handle articles out of the field. 
    - Contribution
        - Combines traditional collaborative filtering based on latent factor models and probabilistic topic modelling. 
        - Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling of text corpora.
